### Minimum Hardware Specifications for bi-directional connection

| Network Bandwidth   | CPU                        | RAM           | SWAP  | Storage Read Speed  |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | ------------- | ----- | ------------------- |
| **100 Mbps**    | 8 Cores @ 2.6 GHz    | 8 GB          | 100 GB| 230 Mbps            |
| **200 Mbps**    | 8 Cores @ 2.6 GHz     | 16 GB          | 100 GB| 360 Mbps            |
| **500 Mbps**    | 16 Cores @ 3.5 3GHz    | 32 GB         | 100 GB| 800 Mbps            |
| **1 Gbps**      | 32 Cores @ 3.5 GHz     | 64 GB         | 200 GB| 2 - 2.5 Gbps        |

<Info>

    - The listed CPU frequencies represent the **base clock speeds**.
    - Storage write speeds are **assumed to match** the read speeds.
    - RAM should be **DDR4** with a minimum frequency of **3200 MHz**.

</Info>


These specifications are optimized for the following network speeds and use cases, ensuring balanced performance across different network environments.
