<Note>The following steps must be executed at every location. If you plan to send and receive data across multiple locations, ensure that each location performs these steps independently, as each location will have its own MongoDB server.</Note>


## Install MongoDB Community Edition

To manage data transfer and users, you need to install the [Mongodb server](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/administration/install-community/) on your system, using the default port 27017.

## Reverse Proxy (Optional)

If you wish to set up a reverse proxy for your setup, follow the steps below to configure Nginx as the reverse proxy server.


### 1. Install Nginx

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="For Ubuntu/Debian">
        ```bash bash
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install nginx
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="For RHEL/CentOS">
        ```bash bash
        sudo yum install epel-release
        sudo yum install nginx
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 2. Configure Nginx

Create or edit a configuration file in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` and link it to the sites-enabled directory.

```bash bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/reverse-proxy.conf
```

Add the following configuration, replacing `localhost:80` with the local port and `ip.provided.by.us:port` with the target IP and port:

```script nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name localhost;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://{license_ip}:{license_port};
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

Enable the configuration by linking the file:

```bash bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/reverse-proxy.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

### 4. Restart Nginx:

```bash bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```


## Setup Daemon server

Run `daemon.bin` as system daemon service

1. Make the script executable:

<CodeGroup>

    ```bash bash
    sudo chmod +x /opt/zetarya/daemon.bin
    ```

</CodeGroup>

2. Before running it as a daemon, execute bin file manually for the first time. This will prompt you to enter the license IP address provided by us and the name of the current location.

<CodeGroup>

    ```bash bash
    sudo /opt/zetarya/daemon.bin
    ```

</CodeGroup>

3. Create the service file: You'll create a service file for the zetarya service in the /etc/systemd/system/ directory.

<CodeGroup>

    ```bash bash
    sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/zetarya.service
    ```

</CodeGroup>

4. Define the service: Add the following content to the service file:

<CodeGroup>

    ```script ini
    [Unit]
    Description=Zetarya Daemon Service
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    ExecStart=/etc/daemon.bin
    Restart=on-failure
    User=nobody
    Group=nogroup
    Environment=ENV_VAR=example_value
    WorkingDirectory=/etc

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

    ```

</CodeGroup>

5. Reload the systemd daemon: This step makes systemd aware of the new service.

<CodeGroup>

    ```bash bash
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl enable zetarya.service
    sudo systemctl start zetarya.service
    ```

</CodeGroup>

> Repeat above process on both sending and receiving side except reverse proxy
