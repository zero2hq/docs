## Reverse Proxy Configuration

The reverse proxy server is used to handle requests and ensure that the organization remains disconnected from the internet. Below is the sample configuration of nginx server.

```bash nginx
server {
        listen 8080;
        server_name xyz;
        location / {
            proxy_pass https://license.zetarya.com;
        }
        location /licence {
            proxy_pass https://license.zetarya.com;
            proxy_set_header Authorization \$http_authorization;
    }
}
```



Please make sure that your pipeline integrates this configuration to meet your organization's needs. This setup ensures a secure and efficient routing mechanism while maintaining the integrity of sensitive data related to the license.
