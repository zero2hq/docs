### 1. Update Configuration

Before running `install.sh`, edit the `daemon.config` file to suit your needs.
On receive fullpath please add `/` at the end as it is a folder where you will receive all your data at current location.

### 2. Run Installation Script

Execute `install.sh` to automatically:

- Install the database as a daemon.
- Run the Zetarya server as a daemon.

### 3. Verify Installation

After installation, use the following commands to confirm everything is set up correctly.

#### Verify Admin User

Create an admin with the default password (you can change it later):

```bash
curl http://localhost:6002/admin
```

#### Check License Information

Retrieve your license details. If it shows 0 available license, the license could not be fetched:

```bash

```
